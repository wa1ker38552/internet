# internet
A simple website to show others if you have internet or not.

Could be used to show other people if you internet is down lol.

**?**
Works by sending requests locally to a Flask application hosted online. If the Flask application notices that it hasn't been pinged for 10 seconds, it'll assume that the internet is down on the local device.

**Getting Started**
1. On a local python interpreter, drag and drop the contents of pycharm into a new environment.
2. On a online interpreter, such as replit, drag and drop the contents of replit.
3. If deploying on replit, just run main.py.
4. Run main.py on your local IDE.
5. Setup an uptime pinger on your Flask application to make sure it's running 24/7.

You're all done!
